Added a learner. Basicly, the learner does the same as the
debugger, but the learner prints more extensive information.

4 june 2013
Added a raw protocol. This enables the sending of raw codes like
they are outputted by the debugger. This is especially handy for
protocols that aren't available yet.

Made the CLI arguments modular so each device can specify
what CLI arguments it can handle / requires

Added a small debugger which tries to print out all necessary
codes to create a custom protocol. If will also help to figure
out how the protocol works.
